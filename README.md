The Talon Hand

The Talon hand is a basic five-fingered device that was developed to be very robust. It is suitable for moderately heavy lifting. The Talon offers very good grip strength, but relies on a long range of motion. Here's a clip of Peregrine Hawthorn putting on his Talon 2.2:

Printing
Everything should print fine on an FDM/FFF (typical desktop filament-fed) printer with no support. Sometimes there's “noodling” (stray filament that can be broken off with a fingernail or hard object) on the back of the distals/fingertips, but even so, it’s usually best to print with zero support and cut off stray noodles, since removing support material from thin cable channels is frustrating and time-consuming. Ody Hand distals have built-in support, so no support should ever need to be added. Built-in support is an upcoming feature for the distal phalanges of all AlderHand designs.
Print scale will affect recommended print settings. 
Three perimeters/shells are recommended for small prints like 100-110% and 5 or 6 for large sizes, around 160%. That makes the holes very dense, giving screws a nice solid block to bite into.

A generous infill is recommended. For the unipalm and gauntlet 70-96%. Make the fingers lighter in weight to reduce the force needed for extension. Four perimeters with 30% infill is fine for the distals at 160% scale, although make sure to print enough perimeters to make the thin parts of hinges solid, printed at a scale of 100%, you should still have 3 perimeters and not fewer.

Smaller scales should print with .2mm layer height, but above 140%, printing may take a long time. To speed up production with larger devices and parts, .3mm layer height is acceptable. Printing in ABS and finishing with acetone vapor causes print layers to vitrify, yielding a surface as smooth as that of injection castings; in this case, thicker layers are not a problem, except at small scales that require fine detail.
If printing in PLA or nylon and without time constraints, there is no problem printing with .1mm layers, but most clients are happy with .2mm layers.

Different print scales, extruder calibrations, materials, and finishing methods will affect tolerances in various ways, and you may find that the fit between printed parts is too tight. If this is the case, you have options.
If snap-pins are too tight, gently drill out the snap-pin holes to a slightly larger diameter. 
If proximal phalanges fit too tightly into the palm and/or the distals, ppsnap4small.stl are slightly narrower proximals for the Talon Hand and Flextensor, and will reduce the need for post-print finishing of mechanical surfaces.

Leather
AlderHands typically require three pieces of leather. Ideal thickness will mostly depend on the print scale of the device, so for a child, use thinner (lower oz) and for a large adult, use thicker (higher oz) leather. Two smaller pieces of leather make the palm shoe, by screwing down a sandwiched leather sole and upper into the holes on the ventral side of the palm bracket. The palm or sole of the hand is small, just an outline of the printed palm (a printable stencil file is included) and very thick, 5-8 oz thickness. The upper should be 3-5 oz leather. The third piece is a large arc of leather, 3-5 oz thickness, which wraps into a conic section to conform to the forearm of the user. Once the leather pieces have been cut out and punched or drilled, they should be made very soft with a combination of leather conditioners, water, and physically bending and stretching the leather until they are supple enough to conform comfortably to the user. When stretching is complete, let the leather dry, then finish all smooth exterior surfaces. Shoe polish, mink oil, beeswax boot waterproofer, and other finishing products have been used with good success. Please select nontoxic ingredients, especially if the device will be used by or near near small children. Wipe away any excess oils and let dry completely before mounting leather to printed parts. Tools needed for constructing the leather pieces are a sturdy pair of scissors and a heavy-duty hole punch.

Straps and Closures
Nylon or polypro webbing goes around the outside of the leather to fasten the device to the user, and can be used to reinforce other areas, such as the palm. Velcro, buckles or double D-ring fasteners are used to tighten and secure the strap or straps. Typically two straps are used, although more user data is needed to determine if using a single strap is ultimately preferable.

Flexor cables
In all 3 devices, zero-stretch cables run through the anterior channels of the distals, proximals and unipalm, then pass through their respective holes in the cable guide and finally attaching to the cable anchor or tensioner block. Braided fishing line is recommended, although trimmer line (used for landscaping) has been used with good success. 

Two sets of distals/fingertips are available for the Talon and Flextensor designs. 
Ball-end distals have cable channels that terminate as funnel-like holes. These are intended to accommodate ball-ends. A ball-end can be a large knot in the end of a braided cable, or the balled end of a monofilament that has been melted with a small flame, such as a lighter. Once a ball-end has been set in a hole, it can be epoxied into place.
Tie-off distals terminate with tie bars and are suitable for only for limp cabling, such as braided line, that can be tied into a tight knot around the tie bars. 

Cable Anchor or Tensioner? To secure the proximal ends of flexor cables, two options are available: the cable anchor and the tensioner block and pins.
The cable anchor is a single printed block with channels for cables and holes for a set screw to pin each cable. All flexor cables, including heavy-gauge nylon monofilament and heavy-duty braided line, are compatible with the cable anchor.
 Tensioner pins rely on tied knots, so only braided line is compatible with the tensioner at this time. Tensioner pins insert into a tensioner block and are secured and adjusted using long (¾”-1¼”) pan head screws

Extensors 
Talon, Ody and Elli hands typically require elastics to extend the fingers. Common hair ties cut to length provide suitable elastic material, although any elastic material with a low-friction surface and very fast response time can be used. Two exceptions to the use of elastics are currently in use. 
If the cable anchor is mounted forward and close to the cable guide and heavy gauge monofilament is used as flexor cables, the hand may open without elastics. Bowden qualities of heavy-gauge nylon monofilament may provide enough “push” to extend the fingers when the wrist is extended. Bowden extension is more effective on smaller builds and fingers printed with lower infill, to make them lighter in weight.
The Flextensor uses a mechanical return system, so 10 cables (5 heavy-gauge for flexors and 5 light-gauge for extensors) are used. 

Arm Bars and the Lopro Gauntlet
Screws are used to mount leather and straps to the printed gauntlet parts. For Talon, Ody and Elli hands, there are two options for the printed gauntlet parts. 
Leather is attached to arm bars with ten flat-head screws, and to a triangular cable anchor or tensioner block with three similar screws. Ody bars are designed for a gauntlet with a single-strap on the third mounting hole, counting distally from the most proximal hole. There is a space so the strap is comfortable between the plastic and the leather. Talon Bars are for an adult's device and use two straps. Attach the straps in the first and fourth holes, so the straps lie in the gaps.
Leather is attached to a low profile (lopro) gauntlet with six flat-head screws. Frankie Flood’s wrist hinges and dovetail tensioner block are available in the Lopro design. 
The Flextensor gauntlet mounts to leather like a lopro gauntlet, but uses neither the snap-pin wrist hinges nor a dovetail block.
